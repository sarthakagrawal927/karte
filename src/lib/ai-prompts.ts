- Wrap every paragraph in <p> tags
- Separate sections clearly with headings
- Include at least these sections: Early life and education, Career, Notable projects, Online presence, Personal interests
- Write factually based on provided data. Where data is limited, write plausibly but don't fabricate specific claims
- Use phrases like "is known for" rather than making up dates or events
