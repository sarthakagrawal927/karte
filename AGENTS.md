# agents.md — linkchat

## Shared Fleet Standard

Also read and follow the shared fleet-level agent standard at `../AGENTS.md`. Treat this repository as owned product code: protect production stability, keep changes scoped, verify work, and record durable follow-up tasks when something remains incomplete or blocked.

## Purpose
Link-in-bio platform with AI-enhanced profile modes — chat, encyclopedia, roast, and newspaper — deployed on Cloudflare via OpenNext.

## Stack
- Framework: Next.js 16 (App Router, React 19, React Compiler ON)
- Language: TypeScript (strict)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4 (dark theme, glassmorphism)
- DB: Turso (libSQL) via Drizzle ORM for app data — schema at `src/db/schema.ts`; Cloudflare D1 `linkchat-auth` for better-auth
- Auth: better-auth (Google provider + Drizzle adapter)
- Testing: Playwright configured (minimal tests)
- Deploy: Cloudflare Workers via `@opennextjs/cloudflare` (`pnpm deploy:cf`)
- Package manager: pnpm

# Cloudflare deployment
pnpm deploy:cf        # cf:build + deploy to CF Workers
pnpm preview          # opennextjs-cloudflare build + local preview

# Drizzle DB
pnpm drizzle-kit generate   # generate migration from schema
pnpm drizzle-kit push       # push schema to Turso (dev shortcut)
pnpm drizzle-kit studio     # Drizzle Studio UI
```

## Architecture notes
- **React Compiler ON** — do NOT add manual `useMemo`/`useCallback`; compiler handles memoization.
- **Dual deploy**: local dev uses standard Next.js with `file:local.db`. Production deploys to CF Workers via OpenNext.
- **Generated content lifecycle**: `pending → generating → ready | error`. Cached in `generatedPages` table.
- **Rate limiter is in-memory** — resets on deploy. Not distributed.
- **No proper DB migrations**: some tables use runtime `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`. Use `drizzle-kit push` for dev; verify migration strategy before prod schema changes.
- **Knowledgebase RAG**: profile `infoBlocks` use the shared Cloudflare `knowledgebase` Worker through the `RAG_SERVICE` service binding and `RAG_SERVICE_KEY`; legacy SaasMaker RAG is no longer a fallback. Existing user fields `smProjectId`/`smApiKey`/`smIndexId` and `smDocumentId` remain as compatibility linkage columns.
- **R2 storage**: avatar/project images in CF R2. Requires `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_BUCKET_NAME`, `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
- **Visitor Identity**: Uses a dual-storage approach for anonymous tracking. A first-party cookie `lc_vid` (2-year expiry, SameSite=Lax, Secure in prod) provides long-term stability, while `localStorage` (`linkchat_visitor_id`) serves as a fallback and mirror for client-side persistence. Managed via `src/lib/visitor-id.ts` and `/api/track/[slug]`. See `docs/analytics.md` for details.
- Env vars: `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `TURSO_DATABASE_URL`, `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`, R2 vars, `RAG_SERVICE_KEY`, optional `RAG_SERVICE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`.
- Husky pre-push hook configured.
- **Auth (better-auth)**: Auth uses better-auth with the Google provider. `BETTER_AUTH_URL` must be set to the deployed origin (`https://linkchat.sarthakagrawal927.workers.dev`) along with `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` via `wrangler secret put`, otherwise auth redirects/callbacks fail. better-auth state is backed by Cloudflare D1 `linkchat-auth`.
- **Google OAuth setup**: Requires a Google Cloud Console OAuth app with redirect URI `https://linkchat.sarthakagrawal927.workers.dev/api/auth/callback/google`. Set credentials with `echo "<client_id>" | wrangler secret put GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID --name linkchat` and same for `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- **DB migration warning**: `ensureProjectsTable()` logs `[unenv] https.request is not implemented yet!` on cold start. Non-fatal — error is caught and app continues. Root cause: libsql `@libsql/client/web` uses WebSocket (wss://) for Turso but the initial handshake may touch https internally. Doesn't affect DB reads/writes once connected. Investigate upgrading `@libsql/client` if this causes issues.

## Fleet Guidance

### Adding Tasks
- Add durable work items in SaaS Maker Cockpit Tasks when the task affects product behavior, deployment, user feedback, or fleet maintenance.
- Include the project slug, a concise title, acceptance criteria, priority/status, and links to relevant code, issues, traces, or dashboards.
- If task discovery starts locally in an editor or agent session, mirror the durable next step back into SaaS Maker before handoff.

### Using SaaS Maker
- Treat SaaS Maker as the system of record for project metadata, feedback, tasks, analytics, testimonials, changelog, and fleet visibility.
- Prefer API-first workflows through `fnd api`, the SDK, or widgets instead of one-off scripts when interacting with SaaS Maker features.
- Keep this agent file aligned with the project record when operating rules, integrations, or deployment conventions change.

### Free AI First
- Prefer free/local AI paths for routine development and analysis: the `free-ai` gateway, local models, provider free tiers, and cached context.
- Escalate to paid models only when complexity, correctness risk, or missing capability justifies the cost.
- Note any paid-AI use in the task or handoff when it materially affects cost, reproducibility, or future maintenance.
