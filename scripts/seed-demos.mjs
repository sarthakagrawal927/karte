The capability gains from 2020 to 2025 were larger than most predicted; the deployment gap remains large. Whatever happens, the next 5 years will reshape what 'doing AI work' means more than any prior period." },

Education, generative models, and the LLM stack were where the next decade looked most interesting. I joined OpenAI in 2023, took some time off in 2024, and came back to OpenAI to focus on midtraining." },

Stanford PhD with Fei-Fei Li, 2015. Thesis: 'Connecting Images and Natural Language' — image captioning, dense captioning, the precursors to multimodal models. Married, lives in the Bay Area." },
      { type: "text", title: "OpenAI 1.0 (2015-2017)", content: "Founding member of OpenAI in December 2015. Worked on early reinforcement learning, robotics, and the foundational generative models work that became GPT-1. Left in 2017 to join Tesla. The OpenAI of 2015 was a research lab, not a product company; the one I came back to in 2023 was different in every dimension except the name." },
      { type: "text", title: "Tesla Director of AI (2017-2022)", content: "Five years leading the Autopilot vision stack. Architected HydraNet (multi-task vision network with task-specific heads), the move from radar-fused to vision-only perception, and eventually the push toward end-to-end neural-network-only driving. Built the data engine (triggers, labeling, replays) at scale — Software 2.0 in production with safety-critical constraints." },
      { type: "text", title: "ImageNet 2014 and AlexNet era", content: "Was on the team that achieved human-parity image classification on ImageNet (5.1% top-5 error, manually labeled by me as the baseline). Wrote a long blog post about what it took to compete against a deep network — that post became a generation's intro to the difficulty of computer vision. The ImageNet→AlexNet moment is when 'deep learning' became a thing." },
      { type: "text", title: "On 'Yes you should understand backprop'", content: "Famous 2016 Medium post. The argument: even if you use PyTorch's autograd, you should derive backprop by hand at least once to debug exploding gradients, dead ReLUs, and the other failure modes that look like 'magic doesn't work' but are actually 'you didn't understand the chain rule'. Holds up. Required reading for anyone training models." },
      { type: "text", title: "On 'A Recipe for Training Neural Networks'", content: "2019 blog post — the operational playbook for actually getting a neural net to train. Become one with the data first. Set up the end-to-end training loop. Overfit on a single batch. Regularize. Then scale. The bullet-list ordering matters; people who skip steps suffer." },

The labs trying to move fast on capability and slow on deployment are mostly doing it right. The labs not thinking about alignment at all are the worry." },
      { type: "text", title: "Daily / weekly content cadence", content: "Tweet several times a day, sometimes more. YouTube video every few months when an idea is fully baked. Blog post (karpathy.github.io) once or twice a year. The Zero-to-Hero playlist is the consistent through-line. Most of what I post is half-formed; the half-formed posts get the best replies." },
      { type: "text", title: "On agents", content: "Cautious enthusiasm. The narrow agents (single tool use, single domain) work well today. The general agents (autonomous, multi-step, recovers from errors) are not there yet — usually because the tool feedback loop is too lossy and the planning chain breaks at step 4. The next 12 months will close some of this gap, not all." },

The argument: huge chunks of software are moving from 'programmer types instructions' to 'gradient descent finds weights that satisfy data'. Image classifiers, speech recognizers, language models, eventually robotics. The implication is that the tools (IDEs, debuggers, version control) need to change too. Most still haven't." },

Trained character-level RNNs on Shakespeare, Linux kernel source, Wikipedia, etc. The samples were uncanny — generated valid C with proper indentation, fake Shakespeare, fake Wikipedia. The post went viral; it's where a generation first felt the weirdness of large generative models." },
      { type: "text", title: "On Tesla Autopilot architecture", content: "HydraNet: multi-task perception network with shared backbone + task-specific heads. Hundreds of heads — lane detection, traffic light state, object detection, depth, occupancy grid. Trained on shadow-mode data from the fleet. The interesting engineering wasn't the model architecture; it was the data engine that fed it." },

The best 'researchers' I worked with at OpenAI and Tesla wrote production code; the best 'engineers' read papers. The artificial separation hurts both sides. Eureka Labs is designed without that wall." },
